I am so excited about this. Today we are going public: Everyone can just
sign up and use the app. No more waiting for an invitation to the closed
beta.

Of course I am curious about all the new feedback and to see what you
think about the app. So please, **spread the word and invite your
friends and colleagues** to the app.

It's by purpose to go public rather early. There a many, many features
still in the pipeline. But that's not a reason to exclude people from
the app. Everyone should be allowed to have a look, check it out and give
feedback. If you don't like it yet, follow our [blog](/blog) or the newsletter
and come back later to see how the app improved.

As always: Let me know what you think. I really appreciate feedback of
any kind.


Cheers,  
Nils
