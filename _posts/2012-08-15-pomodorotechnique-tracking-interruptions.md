The Pomodoro Technique uses an atomic unit of time which is known as ‘pomodoro’.  Pomodoro is a time interval of 25 minutes. The time interval is very short for a task which decreases the total number of interruptions that can occur during an activity. This way the Pomodoro Technique is quite effective when it comes to reducing interruptions. Even if the time is short, distractions will and can distract you from your task especially when you are focusing hard on something. 

Interruptions which can cause distractions can be of two types; internal interruptions and external interruptions. Both can occur anytime and in any situation. You need to deal with them according to given circumstances. The main difference between internal and external interruptions is that the latter we need to communicate or interact with people where as internal interruptions are caused due the instincts of our mind.   

First, we need to know about internal interruption which occurs most of the time in our daily routine work. These interruptions are caused by your instincts.  It is hard for the brain to stick to one activity due to instincts which cause loss of focus during most of our activities. It happens more often and can be overcome by mental strength. 

In an internal interruption you have to keep focus. If you think that your mind was not completely engaged with the task, you must perform that task again. Do this until you are satisfied before moving on to the next task. Once you enlist the activity then mark a ‘U’ against it which will show that this activity is either unplanned or urgent. Put a small hyphen above it which will indicate about the interruption. At the end of a working day, you will have record of your interruptions which caused distractions during a task. Whenever your instincts get out of control just accept the situation, record the interruption and continue with your work. 

The second type is called external interruption which occurs when someone disturbs your activity physically by requesting something. Both of these interruptions can affect our activity. The Pomodoro Technique has solution for both.

External interruptions are of interactive nature so you need to cut them down by yourself. It is better to sort out a strategy for these kind of interruptions before you start your activity. If you are using an application like PomodoroEasy which is available in the market, then you should not worry about the method of tracking your interruptions because it will do it for you.

An application like PomodoroEasy makes it easier for the user to track their interruptions and keep their records. Once you are in the middle of a pomodoro you should not stop work and do not think about switching your activities. As discussed earlier a pomodoro is atomic, so do not try to divide it according to your need. If you need to leave your activity during a pomodoro, consider that pomodoro void.
