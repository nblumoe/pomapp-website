Pomodoro Technique is used in managing time. The Pomodoro Technique uses a timer which breaks time into intervals of 25 minutes separated by breaks. The atomic unit of time in this technique is known as ‘Pomodoro’. Each ‘Pomodoro’ in The Pomodoro Technique is of 25 minutes. There is no concept of half-pomodoro or quarter-pomodoro. 

Before using the Pomodoro Technique you should enlist all tasks in an Activity Inventory Sheet and then set their priority according to your need. After that, you have to figure out which task you want to do first from your sheet. After selecting a task set the Pomodoro for 25 minutes and start your first activity from your Activity Inventory Sheet. Make sure that the timer is placed properly. It is necessary to place the timer at a place that allows each and every member to see the time in order to work properly if you are working in a team. Do not allow any interruptions in your activity once you start a pomodoro. You are not allowed to split up your pomodoro. During the pomodoro, you have to work on the activity which you have chosen and if your pomodoro is interrupted during the activity, consider that pomodoro void and start a new one from the start. After each pomodoro take a break for about 3 to 5 minutes. Allow your mind to rest and start marking the activities which you have performed. 

After every 4 pomodoro, take a long break for 15 to 20 minutes. During a short break, try to relax and do not engage your mind in any task which requires a lot of effort and thinking. Just go for a walk eat something or drink water. 

The software available in the market like PomodoroEasy gives you a whole package of things used in this technique. You have a digital timer on the screen which keeps track of your pomodoro. A work sheet is also given for you to enlist your task. The best thing about the PomodoroEasy application is that you can evaluate your work progress. It allows you to see all the work done throughout the whole activity and you can compare your performance by checking the amount of work done in each pomodoro. 

However, the basics of the Pomodoro Technique remain the same. Once you are finished with your pomodoro set the timer again for the next 25 minutes. If you finish your task before the time limit just take advantage of the time and start revision of your work. Proof read your task and make small changes if necessary. After completing all your tasks you will have a record of the number of pomodoros took by an activity. PomodoroEasy maintains a record of everything about the task. These records are very important when you have to generate a report of your work. This record will show you that how much time you have taken to perform an activity throughout the project which will definitely improve your performance.
