    <h2>Easy to use Pomodoro timer</h2>
    <p>
    The timer is the hear of the PomodoroTechnique. Our timer is easy to
    use and does nice ticking and alarm sounds. Of course you can mute
    it, if you want to.

    <h2>Create and prioritize tasks on the fly</h2>
    <p>
    Whenever a new task comes up to you, it is easy to store it. Just
    type in the task and hit enter. This way you do not loose focus,
    when you have to create a new task while working on another one.
    </p>
    <p>
    Prioritizing tasks and moving them between the different lists works
    intuitively with Drag&Drop. Again, PomodoroEasy gets out of you way!

    <h2>Track interruptions</h2>
    <p>
    When working on a task you will have to track interruptions. No
    problem: It's only one click! Of course there is support for
    internal and external interruptions.

    <h2>Get reports of tracked time and distractions</h2>
    <p>
    To get the best out of the PomodoroTechnique in the longer term,
    it's great to have some analytics of your tasks. See if you could
    reduce the number of interruptions. Get reports about tracked time
    and see how you improve in estimating time needed for tasks.

    <h2>Mobile and 'out of the way' support</h2>
    <p>
    PomodoroEasy aims at great user experience for small windows and on
    mobile devices. Thus you do not need a big window for it, wasting
    space on your desktop. Also, why not just use it on your smartphone
    or tablet besides your computer?
